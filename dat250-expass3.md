For this assignment i did not encounter any problems for the actual installations of the software, however i did have some problems getting them to run. After installing MongoDB the tutorial tells you to run it with the command "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\data\db", this did not work for me. After some trail and error i decided to move on and i followed the instructions for installing mongosh. I was able to run mongosh.exe in a command promt without trouble which allowed me to continue the tutorial and experiment with CRUD operations. So i didn't really do anything to resolve the problem, i think it still worked because MongoDB automatically launched after the installation.

### Experiment 1: MongoDB CRUD operations
