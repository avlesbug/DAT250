# DAT250 - Software Technology Experiment 2

#### Difficulties
 
In this experiment i encountered a lot of difficulties. It felt like the code given for the exercise did not really match up with the Java persistence API tutorial. Expecially since the tutorial tells us to create a new project at step 6. 
I got the Main class to run without problems, but i never got the JpaTest to run. Whenever i try to run JpaTest i get the error message "javax.persistence.PersistenceException: No Persistence provider for EntityManager named people". I have tried multiple soulutions including going back to the start of the tutorial and followed the steps for manually adding the nessasery JARs to the project classpath without success. The tutorial says that the "EclipseLink Installer Zip" should contain the JARs eclipselink.jar and javax.persistence_\*.jar but mine does not contain any JAR with this sort of name "javax.persistence_\*.jar". 

Because i was unsuccessfull in getting the code to work i obviously do not have a screenshot of the tables created, and i have not completed Experiment 2: Banking/Credit Card example JPA. I assume a link to my code is redundent as it is just the code from the tutorial, not any original code.
