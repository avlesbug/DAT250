# DAT250 - Software Technology Experiment 2

#### Difficulties
 
In this experiment i encountered a lot of difficulties. It felt like the code given for the exercise did not really match up with the Java persistence API tutorial. Expecially since the tutorial tells us to create a new project at step 6. 
I got the Main class to run without problems, but i never got the JpaTest to run. Whenever i try to run JpaTest i get the error message "javax.persistence.PersistenceException: No Persistence provider for EntityManager named people". I have tried going back to the start of the tutorial and followed the steps for manually adding the nessasery JARs to the project classpath without success. The tutorial says that the "EclipseLink Installer Zip" should contain the JARs eclipselink.jar and javax.persistence_\*.jar but mine does not contain a javax.persistence_\*.jar.
