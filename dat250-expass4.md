# DAT250 - Software Technology Experiment 4

## Report

For this experiment i did not encounter any thecnical problems. I did not write working code right away, but i would just consider that a part of the process and not a problem.
I had no problems with cloning and running the code in experiment 1. The postman tool was new to me, so uisng it took some finding out, but overall experiment 1 went smoothly. 
Experiment 2 also went without any hiccups, but obviously it was more challanging and took more time than the first experiment since we had to write our own code here.

You can find my code for experiment 2 in this repository en the folder named "dat250-sparkjava-counter".
