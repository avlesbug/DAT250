# DAT250 - Software Technology Experiment 6

## Report
It was quite difficult to get started with this tutorial. I did not know if i was suposed to start from scratch or clone/download some existing template. The tutorial said something about the java tutorial files, but i did not find any. I ended up creating my own project with maven and then creating the classes from the tutorial from scratch, and after adding som dependencies i got it working. I do not have any pending issues.
